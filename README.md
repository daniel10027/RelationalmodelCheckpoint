## 📘 Scenario

After building several hotels in a tourist area, a hotel director wishes to build a relational database to improve data management. The structure was designed based on the provided ER model.

## 🧩 Relational Schema

### 🏢 Hotel
- `Hotel_Id` (PK)
- `Hotel_Name`

### 🧑‍💼 Employee
- `Employee_Id` (PK)
- `Employee_Name`
- `Employee_Speciality`
- `Hotel_Id` (FK → Hotel)
- `Leader_Id` (FK → Employee.Employee_Id) ← self-referencing (leads)

### 🛏 Room
- `Room_Id` (PK)
- `Floor`
- `Hotel_Id` (FK → Hotel)
- `Type_Id` (FK → Type)
- `Category_Id` (FK → Category)

### 🧾 Type
- `Type_Id` (PK)
- `Type_Name`

### 🗂 Category
- `Category_Id` (PK)
- `Category_Name`
- `Price`
- `Beds_Numbers`

## 🖼️ Relational Model Diagram

Below is the relational model visualized:

> 💡 Each box represents a table, with **primary keys (PK)** and **foreign keys (FK)** labeled. Arrows show relationships between the entities.

---

## ✅ Notes

- One hotel has many rooms and employees.
- Each room belongs to one type and one category.
- An employee may lead other employees (self-referencing FK).
- All many-to-one and one-to-one relationships are resolved through foreign keys.
